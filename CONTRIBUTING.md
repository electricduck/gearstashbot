## Commit messages

This repository is now using so-called "semantic commit messages". Commit messages are **required** to follow the format outlined below.

##### Message fomat

```
{1}[{2}]: [{3}] {4}

[{5}]
```

 * `{1}` **Type**
    * `🧱 build`: Modificications to tasks for build/release process (e.g. Dockerfile, Github Actions, etc.)
    * `📝 chore`: Misc. changes (e.g. scripts, external tools, version bumps, background changes not for the user, etc.)
    * `📖 docs`: Modifications to the documentation (including READMEs)
    * `🆕 feat`: Adding feature, or modifying a current feature, for the user
    * `🛠 fix`: Bug or performance fix for the user
    * `🌍 i18n`: Translations to other languages, or corrections to all languages
         * Translations (to other languages) should use the summary (`{4}`) `translate to 🏴 <language> (<code>)`
            * Use this message even when fixing a translation
            * Try to keep translations in a separate commit (i.e. don't commit changes to the "home" language and other languages together)    
    * `👋 init`: New repo (no summary (`{4}`))
    * `⚡ merge`: Merge branches
         * Use the summary (`{4}`) `branch_from ➔ branch_to`
         * Don't use a scope (`{2}`)
    * `🧹 refactor`: Refactoring production code
    * `🗑 revert`: Reverting a previous commit
    * `🎨 style`: Modifications to code formatting (e.g. missing semi-colors, incorrect spacing, etc.)
    * `🧪 test`: Modificications to unit tests
    * `📦 various`: Various changes (no summary (`{4}`))
 * `{2}` **Scope** _(optional)_: Part of repository changed (e.g. feature, document name, etc.)
    * Don't be too specific: have a look at the commit history for examples, use the class name, or folder name the function is present in.
 * `{3}` **Issue** _(optional)_: Issue number surrounded by square brackets (e.g. `[#123]`)
    * **Do not** omit this if its relevant to an issue (even if its on a branch specific to an issue): it helps with tracking.
 * `{4}` **Summary**: Summary of changes
    * Start with a verb
        * **Do not use** "change", "make", or "update" (exception being when updating libraries)
        * Don't capatalize the first letter
        * Don't put a period (`.`) at the end
